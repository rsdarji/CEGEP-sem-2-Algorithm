#  Printing
# ======================================================================================================================

"""
Basic user output in Python is done with 'print'.
Although we did not see all what print can do.
"""

# print can print anything, int, string, list, etc.

# print can be given multiple things to print

# print can be given a separator with print(..., sep=...)

# print can be given an end character with print(..., end=...)


# ======================================================================================================================
#  Input
# ======================================================================================================================

"""
Basic user input in Python is done with 'input'
"""

# The function input will return the string the user input

# The function 'input' can also take a string to explain to the user what they should input

# To input multiple values, we usually use a while loop

# ======================================================================================================================
#  String formatting
# ======================================================================================================================

# lower: make lowercase

# upper: make uppercase

# capitalise: make the first letter uppercase

# title: make the first letter of each word uppercase

# format: insert values into a string

# split: split a string into a list of string at a character

# ======================================================================================================================
#  Files
# ======================================================================================================================

"""
Python uses a with statement to open a file

This allows Python to know at what point you no longer need the file and can close it
"""

# == READ ==

# You can open a file in read-only mode 'r', this is the default mode

# You can read a single line with 'readline'

# Or read all lines with 'readlines'

# We usually prefer reading lines with a loop.

# == WRITE ==

# You can open a file in write-only mode 'w', this will overwrite the file if it existed

# You can open the file in append mode 'a', this will not overwrite the file an write anything at the end

# You can open the file in read-and-write mode
